2025-02-09 18:13:09.003881,Jonas,*The Garden by Moonlight*   A black cat among roses, Phlox, lilac-misted under a first-quarter moon, The sweet smells of heliotrope and night-scented stock. The garden is very still, It is dazed with moonlight, Contented with perfume, Dreaming the opium dreams of its folded poppies. Firefly lights open and vanish High as the tip buds of the golden glow Low as the sweet alyssum flowers at my feet. Moon-shimmer on leaves and trellises, Moon-spikes shafting through the snow ball bush. Only the little faces of the ladiesï¿½ delight are alert and staring, Only the cat, padding between the roses, Shakes a branch and breaks the chequered pattern As water is broken by the falling of a leaf. Then you come, And you are quiet like the garden, And white like the alyssum flowers, And beautiful as the silent sparks of the fireflies. Ah, Beloved, do you see those orange lilies? They knew my mother, But who belonging to me will they know When I am gone.  By _Amy Lowell_

From that moment on, I only had eyes for you. What a diff’rence a day made. Since I fell for you, Zing! went the strings of my heart. You’re so nice to come home to: Make believe. Tea for two. Magic moments. I’m glad there is you. Just a-sittin’ and a-rockin, Swinging on a star, I could write a book Too marvelous for words. I see your face before me. How my heart sings! Do I love you? ’Deed I do. Fidgety feet, I get a kick out of you. Let’s take a walk around the block On the sunny side of the street. Come rain or come shine, My funny Valentine, please be kind. The best is yet to come. Jeepers, creepers, Time after time, you go to my head. Cheek to cheek, dancing in the dark. Love is the sweetest thing. What a wonderful world! Countdown. Stardust. Close your eyes. Hit the road to Dreamland. You’re my everything. What is there to say? All I do is dream of you. There is no greater love.  By _Carole Boston Weatherford_

Gives a mess its mass. Is why slime never forgets its shapelessness, while memory foam must, in what doesn’t leave an impression. My memory spins our negative capabilities round, round, like a record the dead once held, as if listening were human invention. Imagine someone who only touched needle to vinyl. That generation who lost things as memories, while I run from thunder, huddle inside a train long gone off the rails. I call for an Uber. A call I did not even place. It’s all part of this new deal, for which I am the delay. Oh, blissful ooze. Oh, quantum soldier of fortune. There will be an app for judgment that we can’t delete. You correct me: execution. Let’s get into this. That sentencing is quite empty. The sentence is doubling down. Computerication is enviable. I’m pretty beetles you’d like to stick a pin through & then trash can. Why care for the shepherd tricked into the slaughter pen. Let’s get it out in the open. Herds. Human. Break. Bliss. Silo. Haze. Quant- ify looking forward. To tomorrow, to block me from negative space. Mince this tender. Say slime can be a crown of onions & it cries into my eyes. Say chop away at wing & antenna. Say leave me alone with my own device. Say I’ll refuse rubber shell & puckered mutton. I try & reinvent new spin. It’s a table with too many hands in it. It’s communal as plague. It’s that you were invented, but came first. The wheel who’ll originate the hands that spin it. Say they only reach a single herd so milky & sweet. Say it grazes from beneath the screen, free of my cutting board, where you’re filtering all of my chemical elements, until I’m a looted grave, a generic greeting for the slaughterhouse & day of rest. Say until I press the air like a switch & ask: when. Say you keep all the bells tolling & line every fence in the schoolyard with birds of prey. Say no car can escape into spacecraft or credits. & you cut to blank, cursor still swarming over whatever dares next.  By _Rosebud Ben-Oni_
