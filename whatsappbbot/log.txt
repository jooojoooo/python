2025-02-09 18:13:09.003881,Jonas,*The Garden by Moonlight*   A black cat among roses, Phlox, lilac-misted under a first-quarter moon, The sweet smells of heliotrope and night-scented stock. The garden is very still, It is dazed with moonlight, Contented with perfume, Dreaming the opium dreams of its folded poppies. Firefly lights open and vanish High as the tip buds of the golden glow Low as the sweet alyssum flowers at my feet. Moon-shimmer on leaves and trellises, Moon-spikes shafting through the snow ball bush. Only the little faces of the ladiesï¿½ delight are alert and staring, Only the cat, padding between the roses, Shakes a branch and breaks the chequered pattern As water is broken by the falling of a leaf. Then you come, And you are quiet like the garden, And white like the alyssum flowers, And beautiful as the silent sparks of the fireflies. Ah, Beloved, do you see those orange lilies? They knew my mother, But who belonging to me will they know When I am gone.  By _Amy Lowell_

2025-02-10 19:24:16.931302,Miriam,*Lullaby of Jazz Land: A Found Poem Comprised of Titles from the American Songbook*   It was written in the stars: A child is born. From that moment on, I only had eyes for you. What a diffï¿½rence a day made. Since I fell for you, Zing! went the strings of my heart. Youï¿½re so nice to come home to: Make believe. Tea for two. Magic moments. Iï¿½m glad there is you. Just a-sittinï¿½ and a-rockin, Swinging on a star, I could write a book Too marvelous for words. I see your face before me. How my heart sings! Do I love you? ï¿½Deed I do. Fidgety feet, I get a kick out of you. Letï¿½s take a walk around the block On the sunny side of the street. Come rain or come shine, My funny Valentine, please be kind. The best is yet to come. Jeepers, creepers, Time after time, you go to my head. Cheek to cheek, dancing in the dark. Love is the sweetest thing. What a wonderful world! Countdown. Stardust. Close your eyes. Hit the road to Dreamland. Youï¿½re my everything. What is there to say? All I do is dream of you. There is no greater love.  By _Carole Boston Weatherford_
2025-02-11 18:17:43.539031,Miriam,*Poet Wrestling with {Artificial} Intelligence*   Personification is inevitable. It goes hand -in-hand with reinventing the wheel. It reeks of misfortune. Gives a mess its mass. Is why slime never forgets its shapelessness, while memory foam must, in what doesnï¿½t leave an impression. My memory spins our negative capabilities round, round, like a record the dead once held, as if listening were human invention. Imagine someone who only touched needle to vinyl. That generation who lost things as memories, while I run from thunder, huddle inside a train long gone off the rails. I call for an Uber. A call I did not even place. Itï¿½s all part of this new deal, for which I am the delay. Oh, blissful ooze. Oh, quantum soldier of fortune. There will be an app for judgment that we canï¿½t delete. You correct me: execution. Letï¿½s get into this. That sentencing is quite empty. The sentence is doubling down. Computerication is enviable. Iï¿½m pretty beetles youï¿½d like to stick a pin through & then trash can. Why care for the shepherd tricked into the slaughter pen. Letï¿½s get it out in the open. Herds. Human. Break. Bliss. Silo. Haze. Quant- ify looking forward. To tomorrow, to block me from negative space. Mince this tender. Say slime can be a crown of onions & it cries into my eyes. Say chop away at wing & antenna. Say leave me alone with my own device. Say Iï¿½ll refuse rubber shell & puckered mutton. I try & reinvent new spin. Itï¿½s a table with too many hands in it. Itï¿½s communal as plague. Itï¿½s that you were invented, but came first. The wheel whoï¿½ll originate the hands that spin it. Say they only reach a single herd so milky & sweet. Say it grazes from beneath the screen, free of my cutting board, where youï¿½re filtering all of my chemical elements, until Iï¿½m a looted grave, a generic greeting for the slaughterhouse & day of rest. Say until I press the air like a switch & ask: when. Say you keep all the bells tolling & line every fence in the schoolyard with birds of prey. Say no car can escape into spacecraft or credits. & you cut to blank, cursor still swarming over whatever dares next.  By _Rosebud Ben-Oni_

Blessed are your floral shorteralls, your deeply pink fanny pack with travel-size lint roller just in case. Level of splendiferous in your outfit: 200. Types of invisible pain stemming from adolescent disasters in classrooms, locker rooms, & quite often Toyota Camrys: at least 10,000. You are not a jigglypuff, not yet a wigglytuff. Reporters & fathers call your generation “the worst.” Which really means “queer kids who could go online & learn that queer doesn’t have to mean disaster.” Or dead. Instead, queer means, splendiferously, you. & you means someone who knows that common flavors for ice cream sandwiches in Singapore include red bean, yam, & honeydew. Your powers are great, are growing. One day you will create an online personality quiz that also freshens the breath. The next day you will tell your father, You were wrong to say that I had to change . To make me promise I would. To make me promise . & promise .  By _Chen Chen_
