2025-02-09 18:13:09.003881,Jonas,*The Garden by Moonlight*   A black cat among roses, Phlox, lilac-misted under a first-quarter moon, The sweet smells of heliotrope and night-scented stock. The garden is very still, It is dazed with moonlight, Contented with perfume, Dreaming the opium dreams of its folded poppies. Firefly lights open and vanish High as the tip buds of the golden glow Low as the sweet alyssum flowers at my feet. Moon-shimmer on leaves and trellises, Moon-spikes shafting through the snow ball bush. Only the little faces of the ladies� delight are alert and staring, Only the cat, padding between the roses, Shakes a branch and breaks the chequered pattern As water is broken by the falling of a leaf. Then you come, And you are quiet like the garden, And white like the alyssum flowers, And beautiful as the silent sparks of the fireflies. Ah, Beloved, do you see those orange lilies? They knew my mother, But who belonging to me will they know When I am gone.  By _Amy Lowell_

2025-02-10 19:24:16.931302,Miriam,*Lullaby of Jazz Land: A Found Poem Comprised of Titles from the American Songbook*   It was written in the stars: A child is born. From that moment on, I only had eyes for you. What a diff�rence a day made. Since I fell for you, Zing! went the strings of my heart. You�re so nice to come home to: Make believe. Tea for two. Magic moments. I�m glad there is you. Just a-sittin� and a-rockin, Swinging on a star, I could write a book Too marvelous for words. I see your face before me. How my heart sings! Do I love you? �Deed I do. Fidgety feet, I get a kick out of you. Let�s take a walk around the block On the sunny side of the street. Come rain or come shine, My funny Valentine, please be kind. The best is yet to come. Jeepers, creepers, Time after time, you go to my head. Cheek to cheek, dancing in the dark. Love is the sweetest thing. What a wonderful world! Countdown. Stardust. Close your eyes. Hit the road to Dreamland. You�re my everything. What is there to say? All I do is dream of you. There is no greater love.  By _Carole Boston Weatherford_
2025-02-11 18:17:43.539031,Miriam,*Poet Wrestling with {Artificial} Intelligence*   Personification is inevitable. It goes hand -in-hand with reinventing the wheel. It reeks of misfortune. Gives a mess its mass. Is why slime never forgets its shapelessness, while memory foam must, in what doesn�t leave an impression. My memory spins our negative capabilities round, round, like a record the dead once held, as if listening were human invention. Imagine someone who only touched needle to vinyl. That generation who lost things as memories, while I run from thunder, huddle inside a train long gone off the rails. I call for an Uber. A call I did not even place. It�s all part of this new deal, for which I am the delay. Oh, blissful ooze. Oh, quantum soldier of fortune. There will be an app for judgment that we can�t delete. You correct me: execution. Let�s get into this. That sentencing is quite empty. The sentence is doubling down. Computerication is enviable. I�m pretty beetles you�d like to stick a pin through & then trash can. Why care for the shepherd tricked into the slaughter pen. Let�s get it out in the open. Herds. Human. Break. Bliss. Silo. Haze. Quant- ify looking forward. To tomorrow, to block me from negative space. Mince this tender. Say slime can be a crown of onions & it cries into my eyes. Say chop away at wing & antenna. Say leave me alone with my own device. Say I�ll refuse rubber shell & puckered mutton. I try & reinvent new spin. It�s a table with too many hands in it. It�s communal as plague. It�s that you were invented, but came first. The wheel who�ll originate the hands that spin it. Say they only reach a single herd so milky & sweet. Say it grazes from beneath the screen, free of my cutting board, where you�re filtering all of my chemical elements, until I�m a looted grave, a generic greeting for the slaughterhouse & day of rest. Say until I press the air like a switch & ask: when. Say you keep all the bells tolling & line every fence in the schoolyard with birds of prey. Say no car can escape into spacecraft or credits. & you cut to blank, cursor still swarming over whatever dares next.  By _Rosebud Ben-Oni_
2025-02-14 11:22:38.108770,Jonas,*Summer*   You are the ice cream sandwich connoisseur of your generation. Blessed are your floral shorteralls, your deeply pink fanny pack with travel-size lint roller just in case. Level of splendiferous in your outfit: 200. Types of invisible pain stemming from adolescent disasters in classrooms, locker rooms, & quite often Toyota Camrys: at least 10,000. You are not a jigglypuff, not yet a wigglytuff. Reporters & fathers call your generation �the worst.� Which really means �queer kids who could go online & learn that queer doesn�t have to mean disaster.� Or dead. Instead, queer means, splendiferously, you. & you means someone who knows that common flavors for ice cream sandwiches in Singapore include red bean, yam, & honeydew. Your powers are great, are growing. One day you will create an online personality quiz that also freshens the breath. The next day you will tell your father, You were wrong to say that I had to change . To make me promise I would. To make me promise . & promise .  By _Chen Chen_

2025-02-15 16:15:08.285185,Miriam,*Once upon a Time: Surfside, Miami*   Once and once again I am as I remember myself. Thirty years later, I can still savor the sway of these palms fanning this same wind into syllables whispering good morning in my eyes, saving these todays when I can no longer hear how to live out this passion for breaking myself into poems like this, like these waves that once upon a time are again my loyal loves still kissing my feet as I stroll this shore and glance back at my footprints again washed away. The salty salve of these breezes I breathe, living once again with all my joyous regrets for all I�ve done right or wrong, for all I am now, that is enough, yet not enough, for who I wanted to be once, still searching this sea, still facing this same silent horizon, I ask again: Who am I? What should I do? The answer, as always: Everything .  By _Richard Blanco_
2025-02-16 17:15:37.654870,Miriam,*Pops Dead Four Months. Remembering Pops Taught Me to Float on My Back. Watching �Moonlight� on My Delta Flight After Leaving Abuela Ana�s Casket with Abuelo�s in Santiago, Dominican Republic.*   I�d be lying if I didn�t feel their hands stacked and securing my neck and spine. I got this ease with grief. Cry all I need to not all I want to. Deep breaths. Cups brimming with water. I feel furthest from Abuelo. The god I had then ain�t the Ancestors I have now. I keep baby�s breaths for everyone I hold in the heaven of my brain. Gorilla-taped and lining the sarong my sister Monica gifted me. I tell you, if a flower could be a casket. My therapist helps me see I got things. Things about family and consistency. How love should�ve and should look. Everything isn�t my fault. I love people to see what brilliant light love could�ve made of me. All I am is from grief. Defense mechanism: joy and smile and laugh and dance and hope. Thinking about getting a baby�s breath tattooed under my eye. Imagining how fresh it�ll look every time I cry. Thinking about how it�s been four months since Pops died and the four ulcers they found in Mommy�s stomach the morning of Abuela Ana�s viewing and how Mommy couldn�t come to Santiago to see her parents be together again. I tell you, if death isn�t what makes a family.  By _Gabriel Ramirez_
2025-02-17 18:48:04.269930,Miriam,*Slam, Dunk, & Hook*   Fast breaks. Lay ups. With Mercury's Insignia on our sneakers, We outmaneuvered the footwork Of bad angels. Nothing but a hot Swish of strings like silk Ten feet out. In the roundhouse Labyrinth our bodies Created, we could almost Last forever, poised in midair Like storybook sea monsters. A high note hung there A long second. Off The rim. We'd corkscrew Up & dunk balls that exploded The skullcap of hope & good Intention. Lanky, all hands & feet...sprung rhythm. We were metaphysical when girls Cheered on the sidelines. Tangled up in a falling, Muscles were a bright motor Double-flashing to the metal hoop Nailed to our oak. When Sonny Boy's mama died He played nonstop all day, so hard Our backboard splintered. Glistening with sweat, We rolled the ball off Our fingertips. Trouble Was there slapping a blackjack Against an open palm. Dribble, drive to the inside, & glide like a sparrow hawk. Lay ups. Fast breaks. We had moves we didn't know We had. Our bodies spun On swivels of bone & faith, Through a lyric slipknot Of joy, & we knew we were Beautiful & dangerous.  By _Yusef Komunyakaa_
2025-02-18 20:01:03.765097,Miriam,*Recreation*   Coming together it is easier to work after our bodies meet paper and pen neither care nor profit whether we write or not but as your body moves under my hands charged and waiting we cut the leash you create me against your thighs hilly with images moving through our word countries my body writes into your flesh the poem you make of me. Touching you I catch midnight as moon fires set in my throat I love you flesh into blossom I made you and take you made into me.  By _Audre Lorde_
2025-02-19 16:37:22.388874,Miriam,*Hinotama*   The ball of light that bounced above the concentration camp held�� in its patience the memory of the unusual flower the Japanese man was reaching for when he was shot was born to breathe, to breathe to give life to breathe to give life to friendship blood root apparition The Japanese man had sensitivity and must have thought��� in that desolation that he had been struck by a heart in the air before him, around him a light, tonic mist��� the feeling of wind watching over him Spring  By _Brandon Shimoda_
2025-02-20 20:57:09.398427,Miriam,*Something Like We Did II*   They did not expect to, nor did they find us beautiful despite how much we loved to see ourselves despite the way we dressed our bodies� as though both trying to hide and begging to be seen. The way our hands moved when we spoke startled them and our mouths: the animal sounds we called laughing struck them as a kind of punctuation in a world whose machinery never stopped eating our lives though we had made it though we worked hard to maintain it. This is why they would not harm us: our aggressive stupidity that we could not see�� was visible to them���� like a halo of cellophane capping our heads�which appeared to grow a restless vegetation that we attended more than our actual lives, which seemed to be what we wanted to avoid: our fragility the imminence of History��� and worry about what we called the future� though it had already come while we averted our eyes and often forgot the constellations between which the Earth swerved  By _Tim Seibles_
